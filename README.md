# Cursor Landing Page – HTML & CSS Recreation

This project is a **static HTML + CSS recreation of selected sections from the Cursor landing page**.  
The goal was to closely match the original layout, spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy while using **only HTML and CSS** (no frameworks, no JavaScript).

## 📌 Sections Recreated

The following sections were recreated:

1. **Header / Navigation**
   - Cursor logo on the left
   - Navigation links (Features, Enterprise, Pricing, Resources)
   - Call-to-action buttons (Sign in, Download)
   - Proper horizontal spacing using padding (not edge-stuck)

2. **Hero Section**
   - Dark background
   - Two-line headline:
     > “Built to make you extraordinarily productive,  
     > Cursor is the best way to code with AI.”
   - Primary download button
   - Tight vertical spacing (Cursor-style, not overly tall)

3. **Features Section**
   - Three feature cards with alternating layouts
   - Each card contains:
     - Heading
     - Description
     - CTA link
     - Full-width product screenshots placed inside the media area
   - Images fully fill the card’s media container (no mock placeholders)

4. **Product Preview / Image Sections**
   - Real screenshots used instead of recreated UI
   - Images sized and aligned to match original proportions
   - Controlled margins and padding for visual balance
